INTRODUCTION: THE UNIVERSE AS A COMPUTATIONAL METAPHOR

To understand what we are doing here, we need to switch languages for a moment.
Not to a spiritual language, and not to classical philosophy — but to a computational one.

We use the metaphor of a computer not because the universe is a computer,
but because it is the cleanest language we have today for describing a system that operates from within.

In this model:

There is execution — an action that takes place.
From that action, a container emerges.
That container is what we experience as the universe.
Within that container, runtime exists.
And that runtime is what we call time.

There is no external computer.
No operator.
No “run” button.

Execution does not happen inside the universe.
Execution produces the universe as it runs.

And within that execution —
we exist.


WE ARE THREADS, NOT OBJECTS
(And Why We Insist on Feeling Like Characters)

In a model where the universe is the result of continuous execution,
the question “What are we?” cannot be answered in terms of stable entities.

An entity assumes existence even without action.
But here — there is no existence without execution.

An object is something that exists.
A thread is something that happens.

That is the critical difference.


WHY WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY OBJECTS

An object:
- holds state
- preserves identity
- can “wait”
- exists even when unused

But human experience does not work this way:
- there is no real pause
- there is no “self” without process
- there is no moment where consciousness exists without activity

If there is no continuous execution —
there is no experience, no time, no “I”.

Human existence is a stream of execution, not a stored value.


WHY THREADS FIT

A thread is:
- a stream of execution
- with a local stack (memory, context, experience)
- running within a runtime
- and disappearing when it stops running

This maps precisely to:
- consciousness
- subjective time
- the sensation of “now”
- the fact that the past exists only as memory, and the future only as anticipation

We are not in time.
We are time while it runs.


WHERE DOES THE SENSE OF BEING AN “OBJECT” COME FROM?

A thread that is unaware it is a thread
tries to explain continuity.

To explain continuity, it invents:
- identity
- narrative
- character
- a “self”

The object is a convenience model:
a way to describe ongoing execution as if it were a stable thing.

This is not a lie.
It is an abstraction.

But when we forget it is an abstraction,
we begin to believe there is a fixed “self” behind the execution.


THE PRECISE FORMULATION

The universe is execution.
The container (the universe) emerges during execution.
Runtime is time.
We are threads running inside that container.
The “object” is merely the image we construct so we do not fragment under continuous flow.


CLOSING LINE

We are not players in the game.
We are not the characters.
And we are not the engine.

We are the processes running the game from the inside,
and we feel like characters
only because it is hard to live without a story.

And that, perhaps,
is the most human thing about all of this.`,
